### Problem Statement

Accessing relevant news and staying updated with current events is important, but many existing news platforms and services may not cater to the specific needs of the Telugu-speaking community. This can create a gap for users who prefer to engage with news in their native language and seek convenient, personalized ways to access it.

### Project Overview

The Telugu Text Summarizer is a web-based application built using Streamlit that scrapes and summarizes text content from a given webpage in Telugu. The project uses NLP techniques, including TF-IDF and PageRank, to generate a concise summary of the input content.

### Features

Web Scraping: Extracts content from webpages (title and paragraphs).

Text Summarization: Uses an algorithm based on TF-IDF and PageRank for automatic text summarization.

Telugu NLP: Processes and analyzes Telugu text using the spacy library with the Telugu language model.
